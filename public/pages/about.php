                        <h1>About MD5r.com</h1>
                        <p>MD5r.com is a simple tool I created back in 2008 (probably around February 17th). Back then I simply used the site to quickly hash content for database tests when I was developing my other websites, as well as offering a simple way to get the current UNIX timestamp. Now, I've just decided to revamp it a bit and allow people to compare MD5 hashes against a database/dictionary for cracking - nothing new, just for fun :).</p>
